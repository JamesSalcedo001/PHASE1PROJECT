# My First App

For my Phase 1 project, I decided to make an app with the data of a pokedex API. 

## How to Get There

In order to navigate towards my application, all one has to do is navigate to this URL:

```bash
https://jamessalcedo001.github.io/PHASE1PROJECT/
```

## Usage

```python
Three Event Listeners with Event Handlers

# DOMContentLoaded event:
invokes a loop function that fetches from the API and appends 25 items in the form of cards to the DOM

# keydown event with enter/return key
fetches another 25 items and renders them as cards, while replacing the previous 25

# click event with a dark mode toggle button
when the dark mode button is clicked, it changes the document body color to black and some text light blue

#bonus 
if you click the cards, they are removed from the page! 
```
