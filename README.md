# Pokedex!

This is my version of a Pokedex! I used my knowledge of JS, HTML, and CSS to create a different take on the traditional Pokedex, and made in similar to the Pokemon cards everyone loves! Showcasing some of the original pokemon, the page loads 15 cards. To make it more fun, I added a like button, which you can like by hovering over it, Pokemon that hop up and down when you hover over them, and a dark theme button to click when you want to change things up a bit! 


## Installation


In order to work with this project, I had to have HomeBrew installed, as well as have VSCode installed. Run this command to install Homebrew!

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

```

## Usage

```python
# DOMContentLoaded renders 15 Pokemon Cards to the page
Page Loads => 15 Pokemon onscreen!

# Hover the mouse over the button to like the pokemon!
=> hover over => liked!

# Click the Dark Pulse button for a Dark Theme!

click button once => dark theme!

click button twice => back to light theme!
```
